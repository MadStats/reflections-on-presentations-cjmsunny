# reflections-on-presentations

For each presentation, copy-and-paste then fill-in-the-blanks.  You must comment on at least one thing. 



Title of presentation:Fragile Family

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The thesis statement is really clear.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
MSE is a little big compared with the mean of the response.
Maybe have a try of the effect of group variables. This might improve the result of the prediction.





Title of presentation:Mass shooting

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
Really good visualizations.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
The plots are a little more. And maybe make an analysis with the outlier state will have a good result.
And there are different types of shootings. Can they be mixed together to fit the model?



Title of presentation:Voting

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
Detailed description of how they deal with the raw data. And the shiny app.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
Can try do some classification first and fit seperated models to each group.
And the number of covariates might not be enough.



Title of presentation:Yelp

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The covariates are really interesting.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
How do you seperate the distance into group? Is some of the distance group that do not has enough observations?



Title of presentation:Games

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The backgroud is really clear

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
There are many variables. Did you consider a group lasso model for the model selection? And how the class goes into the model is still confused.


Title of presentation:H1B

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The visualization is pretty good.
What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
The repsonse variable and the detailed result is not showes that clearly.



Title of presentation:Traffic

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
Good visualization of plots.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
The two variable you think cannot help with the response may not be true if you consider make a cluster for states first and then do the regression. The conclusion of the residuals plots may not be proper. You can consider some quadratic forms in the model.



Title of presentation:Song

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The way it gets the rhyme is interesting.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
Do you consider the colinearity relationship in the model? And I think that the rhyme becomes more and more with year may just because the length of the some is longer and longer.
 


Title of presentation:NBA

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
Great visualization

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
It is really a little hard to understand some of the variables.



Title of presentation:Terrorism

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked:
The dynamic plots shows the trend clearly. And the explanation for the decision tree is great.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions:
So what is the unit of the response variables? Is it for one country 1 year or for the whole world?
